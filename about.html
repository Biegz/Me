        <h2>I'm Austin Biegler, a software developer, based in San Francisco, California. </h2>
        <br>
        <p>I have always been fascinated by computers. As a kid I would often tinker around with the IBM computers my dad used for work; trying to figure out floppy drives, messing around with Windows 98, playing games, you name it. It wasn't long before I got a laptop of my own (only for it to be destroyed by LimeWire). This further fueled my curiosity for technology, sending me down a rabbit hole that is now the career I love.</p>
        <br>
        <p>My journey with software development started in college, where I enjoyed working on academic assignments and eventually became president for our computer club. Not long after I would go on to start my own web development business, HodoDev Studios.</p>
        <br>
        <p>A few years later, I decided to take a hand at mobile app development. I have always been a fan of Apple and their ecosystem and in the summer of 2020, I took an opportunity with Wutch. Since then I have gained hands-on experience developing software for iOS devices. I now have a deeper appreciation for software and I find myself still wanting to learn more, just like when I was a kid. </p>
