                <p>Wutch: Together, find better stuff to watch. Wutch is an app for all your show and movie recommendations, curated by your friends. With a rapid increase in the number of people subscribed to streaming services; as well as an increase in the number of streaming services available, there became a problem. What do I watch and where do I watch it? </p>

                <h1>Task</h1>
                <p>My role was to bring ideas to life with time complexity, modularity, and efficiency in mind. With each update I managed development timelines, implemented design changes, and communicated with team members to resolve issues and make workflow adjustments.

        <article class="post" style="padding-bottom: 48px;">
            <h1>Results</h1>
            <p>The following design implementations made a direct impact on the usage statistics of the appication. After the release of Wutch: v1.6, which focused heavily on the new "From the Community" card I built, we saw that total user activity went up about 22 percent, with total 'liking' activity going up about 26 percent.</p>

        <article class="post">
            <h1>Activity</h1>
            <p>Each feature required <b>Storyboard/UI Development</b>, <b>App Workflow Adjustment</b>, and <b>API Integration.</b> All UI and UX designs were given in the form of <a href="https://www.figma.com/about/"><b>Figma</b></a> representaions. All features were made using the 'Auto-layout' technique, allowing the app to present well amongst different iOS devices.</p>
